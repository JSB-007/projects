I wanted to inform you that tomorrow I have an important appointment to take my mother to the hospital. I will make every effort to become available as soon as possible and aim to arrive at the office by the afternoon.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused and assure you that I will prioritize completing any pending tasks promptly upon my arrival.
