Hi Dhanshree,
I wanted to inform you that I haven't received any communication regarding the scheduling of the interview or any updates on the PPO selection process. I understand that the HR team might be busy with numerous applications and other responsibilities, but I wanted to ensure that I haven't missed any important notifications.

I remain enthusiastic about the prospect of joining TIAA, and I am genuinely interested in contributing my skills and experiences to the team.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks and regards,

Jasmeet Bhatia
